# Identify ordinal numbers (e.g., first, second, third) up to 5th

Ordinal numbers tell the position of an item in a sequence. The first five are
**first**, **second**, **third**, **fourth**, and **fifth**. Picture five spots
in a row numbered 1 through 5. Each ordinal word points to one of those spots.
Whenever you hear "third" you look at position 3, and so on.

## Representative problem

Five runners finish a short race in the order A, B, C, D, E. Label each runner
with the correct ordinal word from first through fifth.

### Step-by-step

1. List the positions 1–5 in order. → 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
2. Pair each number with its ordinal word. → 1=first, 2=second, 3=third,
   4=fourth, 5=fifth
3. Match the runners to these positions. → A=first, B=second, C=third,
   D=fourth, E=fifth

### Final answer

A is first, B is second, C is third, D is fourth, and E is fifth.

**Check**: Every ordinal word appears exactly once, matching the five finishers
in order.

## Common mistakes

- Mixing ordinal words with counting numbers, like writing "1" instead of
  "first".
- Skipping an ordinal so the sequence breaks (e.g., first, third, fourth...).
- Swapping the order, such as calling the fourth item "third" or "fifth".
