# Understand One-to-One Correspondence When Counting

One-to-one correspondence is a fundamental concept that means each object gets exactly one count, and each count represents exactly one object.

## What is One-to-One Correspondence?

When we count objects, we must match each object with exactly one number word. This means:
- Each object is counted once and only once
- Each number word corresponds to exactly one object
- We don't skip objects or count them twice

## How to Count Properly

1. **Point to each object** as you say the number word
2. **Move in order** from one object to the next
3. **Say one number word** for each object
4. **Keep track** of which objects you've already counted

## Example

If you're counting three apples:
- Point to the first apple and say "One"
- Point to the second apple and say "Two"  
- Point to the third apple and say "Three"

Each apple gets exactly one count, and each count represents exactly one apple.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Double counting**: Counting the same object twice
- **Skipping**: Missing an object in your count
- **Racing ahead**: Saying number words faster than you point to objects
- **Losing track**: Forgetting which objects you've already counted

## Why This Matters

One-to-one correspondence ensures that your counting is accurate. Without this skill, you can't trust that your final count represents the true quantity of objects.

This foundation makes it possible to understand addition, subtraction, and all other mathematical operations that depend on accurate counting.
