# Write numerals 0-9

Being able to produce each numeral from memory lets you record any whole number. Picture the digits on a short number line from 0 to 9. When asked to write them, you reproduce each symbol in order, forming the familiar shapes.

## Representative problem

Write the digits from zero through nine in ascending order.

### Step-by-step

1. Start with zero. → Write `0`.
2. Move to one. → Write `1`.
3. Continue with two. → Write `2`.
4. Then three. → Write `3`.
5. Next four. → Write `4`.
6. Then five. → Write `5`.
7. After that, six. → Write `6`.
8. Continue with seven. → Write `7`.
9. Then eight. → Write `8`.
10. Finish with nine. → Write `9`.

### Final answer

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

**Check**: Each digit appears once in numerical order, so the list is complete.

## Common mistakes

- Reversing digits, such as writing `2` backward or flipping `3`.
- Skipping a number or writing one twice.
- Mixing up the order, like swapping `6` and `9`.
