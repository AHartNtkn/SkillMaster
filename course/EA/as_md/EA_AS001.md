# Identify numerals 0-9

The decimal system uses ten unique symbols—0 through 9. Being able to recognize each one quickly allows you to read any whole number. Picture all ten digits on a mental number line. Whenever a number is printed, you scan each symbol and match it to that lineup.

## Representative problem

Which numeral is missing from the following sequence?

0 1 2 3 4 5 7 8 9

### Step-by-step

1. List every digit from 0 to 9 in order. → 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
2. Compare this full list to the sequence given. → Notice that 6 is absent.
3. State the missing numeral. → The answer is 6.

### Final answer

6

**Check**: Adding 6 fills the gap and yields the complete list 0–9.

## Common mistakes

- Mixing up similar-looking numerals, like 8 and 3 or 6 and 9.
- Overlooking a repeated digit and thinking a different one is missing.
- Forgetting that the sequence should contain ten distinct digits.
