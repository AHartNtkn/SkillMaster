    stem: "When counting objects, each object should be counted how many times?"
    choices: ["zero times", "one time", "two times", "three times"]
    correct: 1
    solution: "Each object should be counted exactly one time to maintain one-to-one correspondence."
  
  - id: q2
    stem: "What is one-to-one correspondence?"
    choices: ["Counting very fast", "Matching each object with exactly one count", "Counting backwards", "Skipping some objects"]
    correct: 1
    solution: "One-to-one correspondence means matching each object with exactly one count."
  
  - id: q3
    stem: "If you're counting 4 toys, how many number words should you say?"
    choices: ["3", "4", "5", "6"]
    correct: 1
    solution: "You should say exactly 4 number words, one for each toy."
  
  - id: q4
    stem: "What should you do as you say each number word when counting?"
    choices: ["Close your eyes", "Point to one object", "Clap your hands", "Jump up and down"]
    correct: 1
    solution: "You should point to one object as you say each number word."
  
  - id: q5
    stem: "Which is a mistake when counting?"
    choices: ["Pointing to each object once", "Counting an object twice", "Saying number words clearly", "Moving from left to right"]
    correct: 1
    solution: "Counting an object twice breaks one-to-one correspondence and gives an incorrect count."
  
  - id: q6
    stem: "If you count: 'One, two, three' while pointing to 3 balls, what does the 'two' represent?"
    choices: ["The first ball", "The second ball", "The third ball", "All the balls"]
    correct: 1
    solution: "The word 'two' corresponds to the second ball you point to."
  
  - id: q7
    stem: "What happens if you skip an object while counting?"
    choices: ["You get the correct count", "Your count will be too low", "Your count will be too high", "Nothing changes"]
    correct: 1
    solution: "If you skip an object, your count will be too low because you missed counting one object."
  
  - id: q8
    stem: "When counting 5 pencils, which number word goes with the 3rd pencil?"
    choices: ["two", "three", "four", "five"]
    correct: 1
    solution: "The word 'three' corresponds to the third pencil in your counting sequence."
  
  - id: q9
    stem: "What's the best way to avoid counting the same object twice?"
    choices: ["Count very fast", "Move counted objects aside", "Count with eyes closed", "Count backwards"]
    correct: 1
    solution: "Moving counted objects aside helps ensure you don't count the same object twice."
  
  - id: q10
    stem: "If there are 6 cookies and you want to count them, how many times should each cookie be counted?"
    choices: ["0 times", "1 time", "2 times", "6 times"]
    correct: 1
    solution: "Each cookie should be counted exactly 1 time for accurate counting."
  
  - id: q11
    stem: "Which shows correct one-to-one correspondence?"
    choices: ["Saying 'one, two' while pointing to 3 apples", "Saying 'one, two, three' while pointing to 3 apples", "Saying 'one, two, three, four' while pointing to 3 apples", "Not pointing at all"]
    correct: 1
    solution: "Saying 'one, two, three' while pointing to 3 apples shows correct one-to-one correspondence."
  
  - id: q12
    stem: "What should you do if you lose track of which objects you've counted?"
    choices: ["Keep going anyway", "Start over", "Guess the answer", "Count twice as fast"]
    correct: 1
    solution: "If you lose track, it's best to start over to ensure accurate counting."
  
  - id: q13
    stem: "When counting 4 marbles by touching each one, how many touches should there be?"
    choices: ["3 touches", "4 touches", "5 touches", "8 touches"]
    correct: 1
    solution: "There should be 4 touches, one for each marble to maintain one-to-one correspondence."
  
  - id: q14
    stem: "Which is NOT a good counting strategy?"
    choices: ["Pointing to each object", "Moving objects as you count", "Counting some objects twice", "Going in order"]
    correct: 2
    solution: "Counting some objects twice is not a good strategy as it breaks one-to-one correspondence."
  
  - id: q15
    stem: "If you say 'one, two, three, four' what should you have pointed to?"
    choices: ["3 objects", "4 objects", "5 objects", "No objects"]
    correct: 1
    solution: "You should have pointed to 4 objects, one for each number word."
  
  - id: q16
    stem: "What makes counting accurate?"
    choices: ["Counting fast", "One-to-one correspondence", "Counting loud", "Using big numbers"]
    correct: 1
    solution: "One-to-one correspondence makes counting accurate by ensuring each object is counted once."
  
  - id: q17
    stem: "If you're counting books and you point to the same book while saying 'two' and 'three', what's wrong?"
    choices: ["Nothing is wrong", "You counted too fast", "You broke one-to-one correspondence", "You should count backwards"]
    correct: 2
    solution: "You broke one-to-one correspondence by giving one object two different counts."
  
  - id: q18
    stem: "When counting 7 toys, what should your final number word be?"
    choices: ["six", "seven", "eight", "nine"]
    correct: 1
    solution: "Your final number word should be 'seven' since there are 7 toys."
  
  - id: q19
    stem: "Which helps maintain one-to-one correspondence?"
    choices: ["Counting with your eyes closed", "Pointing to each object as you count", "Counting as fast as possible", "Skipping objects"]
    correct: 1
    solution: "Pointing to each object as you count helps maintain one-to-one correspondence."
  
  - id: q20
    stem: "If you count 'one, two, three' but there are actually 4 objects, what went wrong?"
    choices: ["You counted perfectly", "You probably skipped one object", "You counted too many", "Nothing went wrong"]
    correct: 1
    solution: "You probably skipped one object, which is why your count is too low."
