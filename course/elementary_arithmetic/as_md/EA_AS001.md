# Identify Numerals 0-9

Numbers are symbols we use to represent quantities. The basic building blocks of all numbers are the digits 0 through 9.

## What are Numerals?

A **numeral** is the written symbol for a number. For example:
- The numeral "3" represents three things
- The numeral "7" represents seven things
- The numeral "0" represents nothing, or zero things

## The Ten Basic Numerals

Here are the ten fundamental numerals you need to know:

**0** - Zero (nothing)
**1** - One 
**2** - Two
**3** - Three
**4** - Four
**5** - Five
**6** - Six
**7** - Seven
**8** - Eight
**9** - Nine

## Why This Matters

Being able to instantly recognize these numerals is essential for all mathematics. When you see "5", you should immediately know it means five things. This automatic recognition makes all other math operations possible.

## Practice Tips

- Look at each numeral and say its name
- Count objects and match them to the correct numeral
- Write the numerals repeatedly to build recognition
- Find numerals in everyday situations (house numbers, prices, etc.)

Once you master recognizing these basic numerals, you'll be ready to work with larger numbers and mathematical operations!
