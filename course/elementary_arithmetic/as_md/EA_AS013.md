# Understand and Use the Plus (+) and Equals (=) Signs

Mathematical symbols help us write number relationships clearly. The plus sign and equals sign are fundamental symbols for expressing addition.

## The Plus Sign (+)

The **plus sign (+)** tells us to add numbers together.

- **What it looks like**: A horizontal line crossed by a vertical line
- **What it means**: "Add" or "combine" or "put together"
- **How to read it**: Say "plus" when you see this symbol

### Examples:
- 2 + 3 (read as "two plus three")
- 5 + 1 (read as "five plus one")
- 4 + 4 (read as "four plus four")

## The Equals Sign (=)

The **equals sign (=)** shows that two amounts are the same.

- **What it looks like**: Two horizontal lines, one above the other
- **What it means**: "Is equal to" or "is the same as"
- **How to read it**: Say "equals" when you see this symbol

### Examples:
- 2 + 3 = 5 (read as "two plus three equals five")
- 1 + 1 = 2 (read as "one plus one equals two")

## Reading Complete Addition Expressions

When you see a complete addition problem, read it from left to right:

**3 + 2 = 5**
- "Three plus two equals five"

**4 + 1 = 5**
- "Four plus one equals five"

## Understanding What These Symbols Mean

### The Plus Sign Means "Combine"
If you have 3 apples and someone gives you 2 more apples, you write: 3 + 2

### The Equals Sign Means "The Same As"
After combining 3 apples and 2 apples, you have 5 apples total: 3 + 2 = 5

## Why These Symbols Matter

These symbols let us:
- Write math problems clearly
- Share mathematical ideas with others
- Solve problems step by step
- Record our work so others can understand it

## Practice Tips

- Practice reading addition problems aloud
- Use physical objects to act out what the symbols mean
- Write your own addition problems using + and =
- Look for these symbols in everyday situations (prices, scores, measurements)

Understanding these symbols is essential for all future mathematics, as they appear in more complex operations and equations.
