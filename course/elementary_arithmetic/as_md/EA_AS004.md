# Count Objects Up to 10

Counting is the process of determining how many objects are in a group. When counting up to 10, you'll use the number sequence and one-to-one correspondence.

## The Counting Sequence

When counting objects, we use this sequence in order:
**1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10**

## Steps for Accurate Counting

1. **Start with "one"** (not zero, unless there are no objects)
2. **Point to each object** as you say each number
3. **Move systematically** so you don't miss any or count twice
4. **The last number you say** is the total count

## Counting Strategies

### Linear Arrangement
- Line up objects in a row
- Count from left to right
- This prevents confusion about which objects you've counted

### Grouping Method
- Move counted objects to one side
- Keep uncounted objects on the other side
- This ensures you don't recount objects

### Touching Method
- Gently touch each object as you count
- This helps maintain one-to-one correspondence

## Example Counting Scenarios

**Counting 7 blocks:**
Point to each block: "1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7"
Answer: There are 7 blocks.

**Counting 3 pencils:**
Point to each pencil: "1, 2, 3"
Answer: There are 3 pencils.

## Practice Tips

- Start with just a few objects (2-3) and work up to 10
- Use physical objects you can touch and move
- Count different types of objects: toys, books, snacks
- Practice counting in different arrangements (scattered, grouped, in lines)

## What Comes Next

Once you can reliably count objects up to 10, you'll be ready to learn about number relationships, simple addition, and working with the symbols that represent these quantities.
